<h2 class="sans">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>I have been staying recently at Oxford, the home of perennial
youth&mdash;and of innumerable dogs. In fact, it was the canine aspect
of Oxford that impressed me on this occasion more than any other.
Nearly every self-respecting undergraduate keeps his dog, and the
medi√¶val, academic look of the place is pleasantly tempered by these
careless, happy, intrusive, "warlike wearers of the wagging tail,"
who career up the High, make the meadows to resound with their
barkings, and bring the bicycled rowing coach to eternal smash on
the tow-path. There being, roughly speaking, some 3,000 undergraduates,
the floating population of Oxford dogs cannot be less
than 2,500.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>Perhaps, however, the most remarkable thing about Oxford dogs
is the variety of their migrations. Some dogs, of course, remain
constant to one owner. Others spend their lives under the general
ownership of the whole University. These know the best rooms for
bones from term to term; they can track the perfumed ash-pan to
its lair, and indulge in hideous orgies of fish-heads and egg-shells.
The most prominent representative of this class is, of course, <i>Oriel
Bill</i>, who has, perhaps, the most gorgeously ugly and tenderly
pathetic face ever granted by nature to a bull-dog.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>But ordinary dogs, though they remain nominally the possession
of one original owner, migrate from sub-owner to deputy-sub-owner,
and thence to pro-deputy-sub-owner, with a wonderful rapidity.
For instance, I once gave a retriever puppy to an Oxford friend.
This is the life-history of that amiable animal, so far as I can gather
it up to a recent date.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>A. (my friend) kept the dog faithfully for a term. As he was
going down, it occurred to A. that <i>Ponto</i> would be happier in Oxford
than in London, so when the following term began, <i>Ponto</i>, still in
his gay puppyhood, was once more found in Oxford under a different
master, B. B. kept <i>Ponto</i> in his lodgings in the High. They were
prettily furnished; there were cretonnes, and embroidered cushions,
and handsome rugs. One day <i>Ponto</i> was left in solitary charge for
one short hour. Upon B.'s return he found that remarkable dog
sleeping soundly, with a well-gnawed slipper under each of his forepaws,
amidst a ruin of tattered stuffs. Not a hanging, not a cushion,
not a rug remained entire. This was too much, and <i>Ponto</i> promptly
became the fleeting property of C., a Balliol man, who changed his
name to <i>Jowler</i> (this happened in the time of the late Master), and
taught him to worry cats.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>After three weeks of glorious scrimmages amongst the surrounding
feline inhabitants, <i>Jowler</i> took it into his head to get lost for a
week. C. mourned him, but took no further steps when he found him
living under the protection of D., a Brasenose man, totally unknown
to A., the original owner. D. took him home in the vac, broke him
to the gun, imbued him with an extraordinary fondness for beer, and
re-christened him "<i>Hebby</i>."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>At the beginning of the following term <i>Hebby</i> once more turned
up in Oxford, being then almost a full-grown dog. He again lived
in lodgings, this time in Turl Street. By this time he had acquired
luxurious habits, and was particularly fond of taking his naps in any
bed that might be handy. Having on four separate occasions
covered himself with mud and ensconced himself in the bed of the
landlady, he was not as popular as a dog of his parts ought to have
been. But the culminating point was reached when <i>Hebby</i>, having
stolen a cold pheasant and the remains of a leg of mutton, took the
bones to the bed of his master, into which he tucked himself. After
this he was passed onto E., a Magdalen man, and was called <i>The Pre</i>.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>I cannot follow his wanderings after this point in any detail. I
know he has gone the round of the Colleges twice. He has been
a boating dog, a cricketing dog, an athletic dog, and a footballing
dog. He has been a canine member of Vincent's Club; he has
waited outside the Union unmoved while a debate, on which
the fate of the Ministry hung, was in progress. He has been
smuggled into College, he has disgraced himself, and caused a change
of carpets in nearly every lodging in Oxford. He has lived near
New College under the name of <i>Spoo</i>, has been entered at Christ
Church as <i>Fleacatcher</i> (a delicate compliment to distinguished oarsman),
and has frequented the precincts of the Radcliffe Infirmary,
and been joyfully hailed as <i>Pego</i> by budding doctors. I believe he
is still a resident member of the University, but his exact place of
residence is more than I can tell. His original owner endeavoured
to trace him not long ago. He got as far as Lincoln College, and
there lost the clue.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>This, I am sure, is no solitary example. Hundreds of Oxford
dogs are at this very time undergoing the same vicissitudes, through
a similar Odyssey of wanderings. And probably, if the truth were
known, there are Cambridge dogs in no better case.</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/217b-340.png"><img src="images/217b-150.png" width="150" height="265" alt="'This scribe for publishers ne'er writes in vain'" /></a></div>

<p>"I like it muchly," quoth the Baron, finishing <span class="sc">Baring Gould's</span>
<i>No√´mi</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"This scribe for publishers ne'er writes in vain;</p>
<p>His pen prolific, Baring Goulden grain."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And <i>No√´mi</i>, if a trifle less Gouldish than Weymanish, is a tale of
stirring times, when to plunder, hack, stab, and string up a few
unfriendly fellow-creatures, who would have done the same by you if
the turn of luck had been theirs, came in the
day's work; while to roast an offender whole
"all alive O," just for once and away, was, so
to speak, "quite a little 'oliday," as a special
and exceptional treat. And all these jocular
barbarities were occasioned, not by any religious
fervour, or by intolerant persecuting
zeal, excusing itself on the score of anxiety for
future spiritual welfare of victim, but simply
out of pure cussedness, and for the humour of
the thing, much as, now-a-days, the bowie-knife
and the cord are used "down West."
Personally, the Baron gives not full credit to
all these tales of medi√¶val cruelty, but the
"scenes and properties" serve an excellent
artistic purpose, and so he loves them as he
loves such romances as those of <i>She who
must be obeyed</i>, and <i>Treasure Island</i>. Therefore
here's to the lass <i>No√´mi</i>, and, as she
herself would of course say, in response to
the toast, "You'll like me the more you <i>Know-o'-me</i>."</p>

<p>Another capital story by <span class="sc">Frank Barrett</span>, entitled <i>A Set of
Rogues</i>, is strongly recommended by the faculty; the faculty in question
being that of deciding upon what sort of book is certain to suit
the tastes of the majority of romance-readers, who, aweary of the
plodding every-day business in this "so-called nineteenth century,"
like to get away from it occasionally and live, just for a change, in
the seventeenth. Stirring tale this of <i>A Set of Rogues</i>, without a
dull chapter in it: and just enough human sentiment in it to soften
down the roguery. In fact, so skilfully is the tale told that the
reader will find himself siding with "their knavish tricks"; for
the hearts of these rogues are in the right place, though their
bodies very seldom were, and their heads never, in the noose. But
"no noose is good noose," and so let the honest reader procure
the book from <span class="sc">Innes &amp; Co.</span> of Bedford Street; he will come to
love the scoundrels, and will ask, with the Baron, "What on earth
became of that captivating <i>Don Sanchez?</i>" and another query,
"Was the villainous old Steward really killed?" Perhaps the
author is reserving the Don and the Steward for another romance.
If so, "What will he do with 'em?" asks the</p>

<h3>THE TWO SOLDIERS' TEARS.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>Some way after Thomas Haynes Bayly's

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>When at the porch he turned,</p>
<p class="i2">To take a last fond look.</p>
<p>(Human emotion will have way</p>
<p class="i2">In <span class="sc">Tommy</span> or in Duke.)</p>
<p>He listened to the tramp,</p>
<p class="i2">So familiar to his ear;</p>
<p>And the soldier gripped his good old sword,</p>
<p class="i2">And wiped away a tear.</p>

<p>Not far from that same porch</p>
<p class="i2">A Tommy stood at ease,</p>

<p>That <span class="sc">Tommy</span> cried, and with his cuff,</p>

<p>Both turned, and left the spot,</p>
<p class="i2">Oh! do not deem them weak,</p>

<h3>A YELL FROM THE YELLOW.</h3>

<p>The "Yellow Dwarf" (in the <i>Yellow Book</i>),
in an almost incoherent scream against the
literary ladies and gentlemen of the day, wails
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The bagman and the stockbroker's clerk (and
their lady wives and daughters) 'ave usurped his
(the 'gentleman and scholar''s) plyce, and his
influence on readers; and the pressman has picked
up his fallen pen&mdash;the pressman, Sir, or the press-woman!...
With an illiterate reading mob howling
at our doors, and a tribe of pressmen scribbling
at our tables, what, in the name of the universe,
can we expect? What we get; not so?"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, "what we get" is (among other
things) the above shriek of the "Yellow
Dwarf," who seems to do his full share of
the "howling" he attributes to the "reading
mob," and who, indeed, might be better described
as the "<i>Yeller</i> Dwarf."</p>

<h2 class="sans">LEAVES FROM THE HIGHLAND JOURNAL OF TOBY, M.P.</h2>

<p class="title1">FIRST LEAF.&mdash;THE THING TO DO IN SCOTLAND.</p>

<p><i>Quiverfield, Haddingtonshire, Monday.</i>&mdash;You can't spend twenty-four
hours at Quiverfield without having borne in upon you the
truth that the only thing to do in Scotland is to play goff. (On other
side of Tweed they call it golf. Here we are too much in a hurry
to get at the game to spend time on unnecessary consonant.) The
waters of what <span class="sc">Victor Hugo</span> called "The First of the Fourth" lave
the links at Quiverfield. Blue as the Mediterranean they have been
in a marvellous autumn, soon to lapse into November. We can see
the Bass Rock from the eighth hole, and can almost hear the whirr
of the balls skimming with swallow flight over the links at North
Berwick.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> here to-day, looking fully ten years younger than
when I last saw him at Westminster. Plays through live-long day,
and drives off fourteen miles for dinner at Whittinghame, thinking
no more of it than if he were crossing Palace Yard. Our host,
<span class="sc">Waverley Pen</span>, is happy in possession of links at his park gates.
All his own, for self and friends. You step through the shrubbery,
and there are the far-reaching links; beyond them the gleaming
waters of the Forth. Stroll out immediately after breakfast to meet
the attendant caddies; play goff till half-past one; reluctantly break
off for luncheon; go back to complete the fearsome foursome; have
tea brought out to save time; leave off in bare time to dress for
dinner; talk goff at dinner; arrange matches after dinner; and the
new morning finds the caddies waiting as before.</p>

<p>Decidedly the only thing to do in Scotland is to play goff.</p>

<p><i>Deeside, Aberdeenshire, Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P., once told
an abashed House of Commons that he "owned a mountain in Scotland."
Find, on visiting him in his ancestral home, that he owns a whole range. Go
up one or two of them; that comparatively easy; difficulty presents
itself when we try to get down. Man and boy, <span class="sc">Fingen</span> has lived
here fifty years; has not yet acquired knowledge necessary to guide a
party home after ascending one of his mountains. Walking up in
cool of afternoon, we usually get home sore-footed and
hungry about midnight.</p>

<p class="center">Fingen's Finger.</p></div>

<p>"Must be going now," says <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P., when we have seen
view from top of mountain. "Just time to get down before dark.
But I know short cut; be there in a jiffy. Come along."</p>

<p>We come along. At end of twenty minutes find ourselves in front
of impassable gorge.</p>

<p>"Ha!" says <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P., cheerily. "Must have taken wrong
turn; better go back and start again."</p>

<p>All very well to say go back; but where were we? <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P.,
knows; wets his finger; holds it up.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he says, with increased joyousness of manner; "the wind
is blowing that way, is it? Then we turn to the left."</p>

<p>Another twenty minutes stumbling through aged heather. Path
trends downwards.</p>

<p>"That's all right," says <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P.; "must lead on to the road."</p>

<p>Instead of which we nearly fall into a bubbling burn. Go back
again; make bee line up acclivity nearly as steep as side of house;
find ourselves again on top of mountain.</p>

<p>"How lucky!" shouts <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P., beaming with delight.</p>

<p>As if we had been trying all this time to get to top of mountain
instead of to bottom!</p>

<p>Wants to wet his finger again and try how the wind lies. We
protest. Let us be saved that at least. <span class="sc">Fingen</span> leads off in quite
another direction. By rocky pathway which threatens sprains;
through bushes and brambles that tear the clothes; by dangerous
leaps from rock to rock he brings us to apparently impenetrable
hedge. We stare forlorn.</p>

<p>"Ha!" says <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P., more aggressively cheerful than
ever. "The road is on other side. Thought we would come upon it
somewhere." Somehow or other we crawl through.</p>

<p>"Nothing like having an eye to the lay of country," says
<span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P., as we limp along the road. "It's a sort of instinct,
you know. If I hadn't been with you, you might have had to camp
out all night on the mountain."</p>

<p class="center">The Crack of the Whip('s Pate!)</p></div>

<p>They don't play goff at Deeside. They bicycle. Down the long
avenue with spreading elm trees deftly trained to make triumphal
arches, the bicycles come and go. <span class="sc">Whipsroom</span>, M.P., thinks opportunity
convenient for acquiring the art of cycling. W. is got up
with consummate art. Has had his trousers cut short at knee in
order to display ribbed stockings of rainbow hue. Loose tweed-jacket,
blood-red necktie, white felt hat with rim turned down all
round, combine to lend him air of a Drury Lane bandit out of work.
Determined to learn to ride the bicycle, but spends most of the day
on his hands and knees, or on his back. Looking down avenue at
any moment pretty sure to find W. either running into the iron
fence, coming off sideways, or bolting head first over the handles
of his byke. Get quite new views of him fore-shortened in all
possible ways, some that would be impossible to any but a man of his
determination.</p>

<p>"Never had a man stay in the house," says <span class="sc">Fingen</span>, M.P.,
ruefully, "who so cut up the lawn with his head, or indented the
gravel with his elbows and his knees."</p>

<p>Evidently I was mistaken about goff. Cycling's the thing in
Scotland.</p>

<p><i>Goasyoucan, Inverness-shire, Saturday.</i>&mdash;Wrong again. Not goff
nor cycling is the thing to do in Scotland. It's stalking. Soon learn
that great truth at Goasyoucan. The hills that encircle the house
densely populated with stags. To-day three guns grassed nine, one
a royal. This the place to spend a happy day, crouching down
among the heather awaiting the fortuitous moment. Weather no
object. Rain or snow out you go, submissive to guidance and instruction
of keeper; by comparison with whose tyranny life of the ancient
galley-slave was perfect freedom.</p>

<p>Consummation of human delight this, to lie prone on your face
amid the wet heather, with the rain pattering down incessantly, or
the snow pitilessly falling, covering you up flake by flake as if it
were a robin and you a babe in the wood. Mustn't stir; mustn't
speak; if you can conveniently dispense with the operation, better
not breathe. Sometimes, after morning and greater part of afternoon
thus cheerfully spent, you may get a shot; even a stag. Also
you may not; or, having attained the first, may miss the latter. At
any rate you have spent a day of exhilarating delight.</p>

<p>Stalking is evidently the thing to do in Scotland. It's a far cry
to the Highlands. Happily there is Arthur's Seat by Edinburgh
Town where beginners can practise, and old hands may feign delight
of early triumphs.</p>

is the reason why we are told, in the
<i>Liverpool Courier's</i> "Labour Notes," that
he is "an influential gentleman in England
and <i>very much run after</i> for lecturing purposes."
But alas! it appears&mdash;from the same
source of information&mdash;that, in the United
States, "the running after" is all on the
erewhile West Ham representative's side;
though, being "rationally" garbed, this
ought not to cause him much inconvenience.
It is almost pathetic to learn that the poor gentleman
was in the position of a Mahomet before

<h2>THAMES TALK.&mdash;A Forecast for 1896.</h2>

<p>How greatly improved are the steamboats. They seem to be as
good as any at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Quite so. They are simply floating palaces. You could find
nothing to equal them in America.</p>

<p>So convenient to have a better class for those who can afford a
few extra pence. Without this, we should have never seen that
duchess chatting away with the countess in her own right.</p>

<p>Yes; and so pleasant to be able to get five o'clock tea nicely served
by trim waitresses in a saloon upholstered with satins and ormolu.</p>

<p>And the duke and the viscount seem quite comfortable in the
luxuriously furnished smoke-room.</p>

<p>Well, the sight is not surprising considering that the designer
went to the Junior United Service Club for his model.</p>

<p>And yet the artisans are contented with their part of the vessel.
It certainly was a happy thought to supply their cabins with
bagatelle boards, dominoes, and a five guinea compendium of games.</p>

<p>In spite of the size of the vessels the boats travel at a rapid rate.
No doubt this is attributable to the magnificent engines.</p>

<p>Of course. And really it is very pleasant to travel from Chelsea
to Kew to the sounds of a first-rate Hungarian Band.</p>

<p>The commissariat, too, has not been neglected. The luncheon on
board is worthy of the best traditions of the <i>buffet</i> at Calais. And as
cheap. Only fancy, half-a-crown for three courses and dessert!</p>

<p>Yes; and that meal seems equally popular with the sixpenny tea
(with cakes and crumpets) prepared for the patrons of the fore-part.</p>

<p>The fares are also very low. Even in these hard times it would be
unreasonable to complain of overcharge when the ticket between the
Temple and Hampton Court is only fourpence.</p>

<p>It is marvellous that no one tried the plan before of starting boats
from half the piers for all the rest at five minutes interval.</p>

<p>And yet they are crowded with travellers. Really the Thames
seems to be a very popular highway.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the passengers are sheltered from the weather&mdash;too
much sun or a plethora of rain&mdash;at all times.</p>

<p>And I suppose London may thank the County Council for establishing
comfort with economy, and luxury with rapidity?</p>

<p>Oh dear, no! If the metropolis had trusted to that dilatory body,
it would have had to wait indeed!</p>

<p>Then to whom are the five million inhabitants of the chief city of
the universe indebted for these sweet boons?</p>

<p>To an ordinary man of business who knows how to cater for the
multitude, and has the courage to rely upon increased income as a
means of meeting additional outlay.&mdash;He merits a statue.&mdash;He deserves
more&mdash;hearty praise by the Press when he discards his <i>incognito</i>.</p>

<h3>ROBING-ROOM RUMOURS.</h3>

<p>In consequence of the great success of the "Smoking at Home" at
the Inner Temple, it is proposed to start a circus at the Middle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The suggested "Musical Dinner" at Lincoln's Inn is now under
consideration, and will probably see the gas-light before the end of
the term.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The numerous professional engagements of Sir <span class="sc">Fr-nk L-ckw-d</span>
will <i>not</i> prevent him from appearing as <i>The</i> "Lightning Cartoonist"
at the coming Gray's Inn <i>Matin√©e</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Should the anticipated "Free-and-easy" come off at the Middle,
the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> is not unlikely to give an exhibition of
swordsmanship. The distinguished Peer is said to be the finest
living exponent of the sword and dagger fight.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Lord Chief Justice</span> is expected before Christmas to repeat
his recent interesting address, with the assistance of a piano and
dissolving views. A troupe of first-rate banjoists from the Three-in-a-Bar
Musical Society may possibly be found among the incidentals.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There is no truth in the report that at the next "Five o'clock tea
with pipes" at Lincoln's Inn Sir <span class="sc">'Arry 'Awkins</span> will warble
"<i>Down Newmarket Way</i>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In spite of the social entertainments in contemplation, the
Examiners of the Council of Legal Education will perform their
duties. At present there is no intention of adding another subject
to the pass for admission to the Bar. In the future it may happen
that all students will have to take up "the duties and responsibilities
of proprietors of music halls."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p><span class="sc">From "The Pottery," Haymarket.</span>&mdash;The "Tree-ilby Tree-o,"

<p>"<span class="sc">Ex Pede.</span>"&mdash;Miss <span class="sc">Baird</span> appears as the model <i>Trilby</i>
without

<h2 class="sans">FASHIONS FOR THE FIFTH.</h2>

<p class="title1"><i>To Strachan Shavins, Esq.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Old Strachan</span>,&mdash;So you want a few hints from me as to
what you should wear this Fifth of November. Well, my dear
fellow, of course I shall be delighted to be of any service I can to you.
You needn't have apologised for troubling me. It is only natural that,
as you say, you "shouldn't wish to make a fool of yourself on such
an occasion by turning out in the wrong sort of toggery." Dress is
a more important factor in <i>our</i> profession than is generally supposed,
and we, as Gentlemen and Guys, should be the last to set conventionality
and propriety at defiance by appearing in public without
proper regard to our personal appearance.</p>

<p>First, let me beg of you <i>not</i> to be persuaded into adopting a cocked-hat.
The career of the paper cocked-hat&mdash;with
or without coloured trimmings&mdash;is closed,
and I for one do not regret it, for it always
seemed to me to imply an assumption of military
rank which, on the part of civilians like
ourselves, is surely rather a paltry affectation.</p>

<p>The only correct head-covering will be the
tall hat, which I hear will be bulgier than ever
this year. The smartest will have open crowns
and little or no brims. There has been some
attempt to revive the old straw hat, though
only with a black ribbon, but I have not heard
of this being adopted by Guys with any pretensions
to dressiness.</p>

<p>Masks this year are to be gayer&mdash;I might
even say gaudier&mdash;than ever. I noticed one of
bright magenta with large grape-green spots!
Sounds rather startling, you will think; but,
really, worn with a fustian jacket of a rather
sombre tone of chestnut, and a mock-astrakhan
<i>toque</i>, the effect was not half bad. The
latest idea seems to be to strike the dominant
colour-note in the mask, and make the rest of
the costume lead up to it. Personally, however,
I prefer something which renders its
wearer less conspicuous. One in prawn-pink,
with touches of cardinal red under each eye,
and an edging of the same around the mouth,
struck me as in excellent taste. Another in
<i>bouchon-br√ªl√©</i> black, relieved by sealing-wax
red, was pleasing, though <i>you</i> may consider it
almost <i>too</i> quiet.</p>

<p>After all, the colour and design of the mask
may safely be left to the taste and fancy of the
individual.</p>

<p>Now, as to your coat. The sack-back overcoat
still holds its own, though it is open to
the objection of concealing too much of the
figure. Have nothing to do with a striped
flannel blazer, nor a glazed calico jacket. You
may see one or two about, but never on anyone who is anybody at all.
You cannot go wrong in a double-breasted pea-coat, or one in black
and rather shiny broadcloth, with rather long tails. I have decided
on one myself, and consider it decidedly becoming.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/225-640.png"><img src="images/225-200.png" width="200" height="392" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>Don't be induced to appear "in character." I cannot see any
sense myself in masquerading as some person of more or less
ephemeral notoriety. Why should we desire to mislead the careless
into taking us for a famous murderer, swindler, or statesman? I
know it is done, and by some who ought to be above such weakness;
but, depend on it, it's a poor sort of ambition. Let us be content to
be <i>ourselves</i>, members of the honourable and ancient Guild of Guys.</p>

<p>There seems to be a general agreement to dispense with collars
this year, and adopt instead a red worsted comforter, which is quite
as sightly, and very much more hygienic in these raw, foggy days.
But, if you must have a collar, have one in the "stick-up" shape,
with the ends slightly dog's-eared; the necktie can hardly be <i>too</i> simple.</p>

<p>As for the trousers, they will be of much the same cut as hitherto,
perhaps just a shade baggier at the knees, and falling "concertina"-wise,
to meet the boots, into which they should be tucked.</p>

<p>Soles and heels will either be very much worn, or not worn at all&mdash;there
is no <i>juste milieu</i> here; but eschew boots of a brown colour,
which, on a formal occasion like this, are very bad style indeed. Should
you desire to be thought a very great "buck" and "blood" indeed,
you may have your boots an odd pair. A top-boot
and a tennis shoe make a highly effective
combination.</p>

<p>It is not <i>necessary</i> to wear gloves; but, if
you do, remember to have white knitted ones,
<i>not</i> kid. The finger-ends are generally left
open, so as to produce an impression of elegant
negligence. This may be heightened by allowing
just a suspicion of hay or straw to be
visible at the apertures.</p>

<p>Lastly, you inquire about the best kind of
conveyance to make your rounds in. Take my
advice, and refuse to be carried on a chair. I
would not even accept a barrow, unless it is
drawn by a donkey. It is only once a year,
remember, and a certain amount of pomp and
splendour is essential if we Guys are to maintain
the dignity of our Order in these degenerate
times.</p>

<p>I hear whispers that one or two Guys who
go in for being "up to date" are seriously
thinking of exhibiting themselves this year on
bicycles, and, considering the sudden and enormous
popularity which the "bike" (to employ
a hideous and vulgar abbreviation that offends
my taste) has acquired of late amongst the so-called
"Upper Ten," I am far from saying that
even such a public personage as a Guy must
necessarily suffer any loss of dignity by being
seen on a cycle&mdash;provided he insists upon being
securely tied on to the handle-bars, and also
upon the machine being supported and guided
for him by a couple of able-bodied attendants.
But this, I understand, will be <i>de rigueur</i> for
any Guy who may so far unbend as to give the
practice of cycling the sanction of his official
recognition and countenance.</p>

<p>I think that is all you wished to know about;
so now, my dear old chap, let me wish you a
thoroughly enjoyable day's outing, and a cheery
evening by way of finish. You will find that the boys will do you uncommonly
well, give you as many combustibles as you can hold, and
there is sure to be plenty of fizz about. Sit tight, keep as cool as you
can, don't lose your head, or let yourself go too soon, and you may
reckon upon having what is colloquially termed "a high old time."</p>

<p>I shall expect a first-rate report, and you are pretty certain to
hear from <i>me</i> if I am anywhere in your neighbourhood, so no more
at present from</p>

<h3>MANY LICENSES AND ONLY ONE FISH SAUCE.</h3>

<p>The London County Council sits upon the site of one of London's
oldest casino-gardens ("Spring Gardens"), and no one can therefore
wonder that it sits upon music-halls. It did not open its proceedings
on October 25 with the <i>Chant du D√©part</i>, which was
disappointing. Having gone wrong on water, was it not only natural
that it should go wrong on gin, and in one great case give a verdict
in favour of hole-and-corner drinking? It invented a new dance
called the "Skate Dance." This is something in these days of
choregraphic enterprise. It should not, however, have fettered its
invention with a license. If skating is "dancing on skates," what
is not dancing? Is "dancing attendance" illegal without a license?
Is the "poetry of motion" illegal without a license, and which is
the most illegal?&mdash;the poetry or the motion? Does the "music of
the spheres" require a license? Is the ploughboy, "whistling as
he goes for want of thought," infringing any Act of Parliament?
If I copied an old poet, and asked a young lady to "drink to me
only with her eyes," could she do so in an auditorium without the
permission of the L. C. C. and the Brewster Magistrates?</p>

The French equivalent for the

second person plural, imperative

to cease, which evidently is a

He would have joined before

<h3 class="sans">"PLEASE TO REMEMBER THE NINTH OF NOVEMBER."</h3>

<p>An esteemed and learned contributor, who wishes, for the moment,
to preserve his <i>incognito</i>, has sent to 85, Fleet Street, a suggestion
for the procession of the ninth inst., which may yet recommend
itself to the Lord Mayor Elect:&mdash;"As Sir <span class="sc">Walter</span>
is a barrister-at-law," writes our correspondent,
"would it not be a graceful act if his connection
with the forensic profession were brought in prominence
by suitable accessories?" As the idea is
worthy of consideration, the proposed programme is
herewith set forth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">Constable clearing his throat.<br />
Inns of Court Volunteers, with their bands.<br />
Private Practice (alone).<br />
Deputation of the Junior Bar, a thousand strong,<br />
shirking their military responsibilities.<br />
Master of the Revels of Gray's Inn, in wig and<br />
Maske of Flowers, on horseback.<br />
Deputation of the Junior Bar, with Bar-maids,<br />
dancing.<br />
Treasurer of the Middle Temple seated in a car representing<br />
a Smoking Concert in Hall.<br />
A Solicitor with briefs.<br />
Deputation of the Junior Bar, two thousand strong,<br />
in close attendance.<br />
Hungry Members of the L. C. Sessions who have <i>not</i><br />
received "soup."<br />
The Recorder of London seated in his chariot.<br />
Banner with Recorder's motto, "Come one, come <span class="sc">Hall</span>!"<br />
Full Members of the L. C. Sessions who <i>have</i> received "soup,"<br />
preceded by officer, in uniform of "Marshal <span class="sc">Tureen</span>."<br />
Sir <span class="sc">George Lewis</span> in a big case, drawn by Irritating Magistrates.<br />
Deputation of the Junior Bar, three thousand strong, prepared<br />
for actions.<br />
A car containing all the Judges, drawn by Mr. Ex-Solicitor-General<br />
on a single sheet.<br />
Sheriffs' officers dancing.<br />
Trophy representing the Glories of the Past, including<br />
Effigies of <span class="sc">John Doe</span> and <span class="sc">Richard Roe</span>, and<br />
other celebrities.<br />
One-horse Fly of Mr. <span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>, Junior,<br />
occupied by his Clerk.<br />
The City Marshal alone, without <span class="sc">Snelgrove</span>.<br />
The Right Hon. the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> in full forensic<br />
costume, consulting his Fee-book.<br />
Deputations from various Bars&mdash;Potters Bar, Criterion<br />
Bar, Old Turnpike Bars, and<br />
Sir <span class="sc">Arthur Sullivan</span> representing Bar of Music.</p>

<p>It is suggested by the proposer of the programme
that it would be useless to arrange for any large
number of solicitors to be present. The members of
that branch of the profession are invariable well
employed during term time. But this consideration
does not apply to the younger members of the Bar.
It is understood that gentlemen duly qualified to
take part in the procession can obtain full particulars
by applying to Pump-handle Court, and asking (in
the first instance) for Mr. <span class="sc">Portington</span>.</p>

<h2 class="sans">HOW KIPPER SLEW THE NEW FOREST HORNET.</h2>

<p class="title1"><span class="sc">Chapter III.</span>&mdash;<i>The Restoration.</i></p>

<p>It was a terrible position. The goblin and the hornet glared at
one another as fiercely as two ladies, who have got on the same
patterned frocks. It was one of those moments when you could no
more tell the hour by blowing thistle-down than attempt to make
snowballs out of hoar frost. <span class="sc">Kipper</span> was the first to recover his
presence of mind. "What do you want here?" he shouted to the
hornet with all the virtuous force which he could put into a voice
not naturally bass. "What do you want here?" he repeated, more
angrily; and, nearly cracking his organ of speech, he screamed, with
a superb air of command, "Be off, you rascal! I say, be off!"
The giant hornet smiled in that sort of way which gives an honest
ladybird the creeps, as he growled,
"What do I want? That girl!"&mdash;and
he pointed to the terrified <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>.
"I'll teach her to interfere in my
business. I've no quarrel with you,
<span class="sc">Kipper</span>, so I strongly advise you to
mount your old horny-head" (here the
stag-beetle said a rude remark to himself),
"get out of my way, and let me
do my will." "Never!" cried <span class="sc">Kipper</span>,
drawing his fine sword-grass blade.
"Come on!" "O! <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, dear <span class="sc">Kipper</span>,
don't risk your life for me," sighed
<span class="sc">Eglantine</span>; "please don't." "Keep
quiet!" muttered <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, testily.
"Why do women always interfere in
these little matters?" Then to <span class="sc">Nippard</span>
he added, "Come on, you swaggering
bully, you tormentor of every peaceful
inhabitant, you horrid tyrant, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;"><a href="images/228-850.png"><img src="images/228-375.png" width="375" height="470" alt="'He recovered himself and stood once more on guard.'" /></a>
"He recovered himself and stood once more on guard."</div>

<p>But here the hornet, stung by these
reproaches, tried to reply in similar but
more practical fashion. <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, however,
was too quick for him, and gave
him a sharp prod in the right wing just
as he was swooping down on the crouching
<span class="sc">Eglantine</span>. The stagbeetle clapped
his horns together at the thrust, while
the toad waddled out of his hole and
took notes of the affray without comment,
for he had just as fine a sense of
the value of neutrality as Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
or the <span class="sc">President</span> of the United States.
<span class="sc">Nippard</span>, however, was in nowise discomfited
and made another ferocious
dash, this time straight at <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, who
fenced his sting, but got a buffet on the head from the hornet's
body which almost knocked him off his legs. However, he recovered
himself and stood once more on guard. <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> meanwhile
had pressed some more wild mint between her fingers and
anointed her champion's brow. This seemed to refresh him very
much. As to the stagbeetle, he was too frightened to do anything.
So the fight continued, now <span class="sc">Kipper</span> got a good stroke, now
<span class="sc">Nippard</span>
wounded the goblin, but the hornet was never able to get full power
into his sling, nor the goblin into his sword, so nimble were both.</p>

<p>At last <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, in parrying a most venomous onslaught, tripped
and fell backwards, and, ere <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> or the stagbeetle could come
to his assistance, his foe had pounced upon him. It was a fearful
sight as both struggled on the sward. At last <span class="sc">Kipper's</span> blade was
thrust with a shout of triumph into the monster's body, and he stood
on it as it fell. But alas! scarcely had he done so, when he himself
rolled lifeless beside the corpse of his enemy. He had forgotten that
hornets, like wasps and writers of reminiscences, can still sting, when
they no longer breathe. <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> and the stagbeetle vainly
endeavoured to revive the champion, who had won. He was as
insensible to their attentions as is an ironclad ship to the persistence
of an exploded torpedo. The stagbeetle, who was getting rather
weary from want of refreshment, and hated "scenes," proposed that
he should go and fetch assistance while <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> might watch
the body. This she readily consented to do. Hardly had the beetle
droned himself out of sight when she flung herself upon the remains
of the hero and shed many bitter tears ere she could speak. At
last she cried in her anguish "Oh! my dearest, who was so good
to me, come back, come back, for I love you; yes! I love you
dearly."</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words out of her mouth when the little form of
<span class="sc">Kipper</span> disappeared, and there arose in his place not a prince in
velvet doublet and silken hose, but a
well favoured man of about thirty,
dressed in a tweed suit, with billycock
hat to match. <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>, though very
much surprised, was not the least bit
frightened, not even when the stranger
addressed her. "Sweetest <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>,"
he said, "know that I am not a goblin,
but a human being like yourself. <i>I
was fortunate enough to discover a mine
of virgin gold in Western Australia, and
to have the property assigned to me by
the government.</i> Selfishly I kept the
secret to myself, and thereby incurred
the anger of the King of the Gnomes,
who, as a punishment for my sin against
the welfare of humanity, caused me to
be seized and transported here by the
Underground Antipodes Railway. In
this forest I was to abide in the repulsive
form of <span class="sc">Kipper</span> the Goblin, and to
make myself as disagreeable as possible
to everybody. I have done so, with
considerable success. Only one chance
of release was given to me, and that
was when some pure-hearted maiden
should declare her love for me. My
case seemed hopeless; but you, darling,
have broken the spell, and restored me to
my real self. My true name is <span class="sc">Archibald
Johnson</span>. Will you be Mrs. J.?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Eglantine</span>, having no fixed ideas as
to "the proper age of love," unhesitatingly
answered "Yes."</p>

<p>So the inhabitants of the New Forest,
big and little, knew <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> no more,
and her mother retired to a house in Grosvenor Square, where she
was waited on by a butler who looked like a bishop, and by sixteen
tall footmen, whose discharges from the Life Guards she had bought
at considerable expense to her son-in-law. But he was rich and
happy, and his beautiful wife's photographs were in all the stationers'
shop-windows. No trace of the great fight exists, except the body
of <span class="sc">Nippard</span> the Hornet, which the toad, with an eye to business,
stuffed, and exhibits on bank holidays and Coronation Day to all the
lower members of creation at four barleycorns a head; moles, earthworms,
and tadpoles half-price. He devotes part of the proceeds to
the Home for Decrepit Dormice, so it costs him nothing. As to the
stagbeetle, he joined a travelling circus, after being painted white
with black spots. He was accidentally killed, when doing the hoop-trick,
and may now be seen labelled a "Remarkable Specimen" in
the Natural History Museum at South Kensington.</p>

<h3>CANINE SAGACITY IN EXCELSIS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I can vouch for the absolute accuracy of the following
remarkable instance of canine sense and kindly feeling. My wife
has a little pet dog, with a singular <i>penchant</i> for bones, which he is
apt to litter about in inconvenient places.</p>

<p>The other morning my wife discovered, under her pillow, a half-gnawed
bone, evidently placed there by <i>Tim</i> (the dog), who is
accustomed to sleep at the foot of our bed. Now this is where the
extraordinary intelligence comes in. Our doctor, on the previous
day, had told my wife that she must take nourishment at frequent
intervals, even, if necessary, in the middle of the night; and, when
the doctor said this, <i>Tim was present!</i> The devoted animal evidently
thought this an excellent opportunity for serving his beloved
mistress; and consequently he sacrificed his best and most cherished
bone, that she might have something to eat during the long night
watches. What altruism is displayed by this selection of a hiding-place,
and how it puts us poor humans to the blush!</p>

<p>It certainly was not the dog's fault if a partially-gnawed bone
was not precisely the sort of delicacy likely to tempt my wife's
capricious appetite. A dog cannot be expected to know everything!
All honour to this noble-minded quadruped! "<i>La plus noble conqu√©te
que l'homme ait jamais faite</i>," says <span class="sc">Buffon</span>, <i>"c'est"&mdash;c'est
assur√©ment notre Tim!</i></p>

<p class="author">Yours ever,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sc">Spectator</span>.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>In a letter, published a while ago in the columns of <i>Truth</i>, and
pertinently entitled "Cacophonous London," Dr. <span class="sc">George Weldon</span>
ably pointed out the evil effects upon the nervous system of the
community caused by vagrant singers, shrieking newspaper boys,
German bands, piano organs, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>. We now notice
that Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Fox</span>, who is "organising a campaign"&mdash;this
"<i>organising</i>" is evidently on the hom&oelig;opathic principle that "like
cures like"&mdash;against the nuisance, has addressed a meeting of the
Balloon Society on the subject. But why the <i>Balloon</i> Society? The
"cacophony" complained of is not, unfortunately, <i>in nubibus</i>.</p>
